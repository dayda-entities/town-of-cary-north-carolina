<p>Explore inspections for building permits in the Town of Cary.</p><p>This is the list of all permit inspections since 2011 in our building permits system.  It is loosely based on the BLDS (<a href="http://permitdata.org">permitdata.org</a>) specification.  At this time there is not a clean mapping between the Town of Cary inspection types and the InspTypeMapped values provided in the specification.  As a result, we have left the field blank.  Further we have provided additional fields that ensure that rows in the dataset are unique.  </p><p>Please Note:  This dataset only contains inspections for permits that are in the Permit Applications dataset.  As such, it will not contain inspections for permits that were applied for before 2011.</p><p>This data is updated daily.</p>
