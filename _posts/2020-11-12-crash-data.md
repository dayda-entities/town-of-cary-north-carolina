<p>View crash information from the last five years to current date.</p><p>This dataset includes crashes in the Town of Cary for the previous four calendar years plus the current year to date. </p><p>The data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The data is dynamic, allowing for additions, deletions and modifications at any time, resulting in more accurate information in the database. Due to ongoing and continuous data entry, the numbers of records in subsequent extractions are subject to change.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>About Crash Data</strong></p><p>The Cary Police Department strives to make Crash data as accurate as possible, but there is no avoiding the introduction of errors into this process, which relies on data furnished by many people and that cannot always be verified. As the data is updated on this site there will be instances of adding new incidents and updating existing data with information gathered through the investigative process.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Crash data become more accurate over time, as new crashes are reported and more information comes to light during investigations.</p><p>This dynamic nature of Crash data means that content provided here today will probably differ from content provided a week from now. Likewise, content provided on this site will probably differ somewhat from crime statistics published elsewhere by the Town of Cary, even though they draw from the same database.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>About Crash Locations</strong></p><p>Crash locations reflect the approximate locations of the crash. Certain crashes may not appear on maps if there is insufficient detail to establish a specific, mappable location.</p><p>This data is updated daily.</p>
