<p>View the Town’s current collection schedule, including pick-up day and recycling week designation.</p><p>The Town of Cary collects garbage weekly at the curb on the same day as yard waste collection. The Town provides rollout carts for household garbage that should be rolled to the curb each week. </p><p>Rows in this dataset represent contiguous geographical areas (polygons) containing addresses on the same route.  They do not represent individual addresses on a route or distinct routes.  As a result, the numbers you see in the facet/filtering area do not represent any meaningful information.</p><p>The Town collects recycling every other week on the same day as garbage and yard waste collection.</p><p>For more information please refer to<a href="http://www.townofcary.org/Departments/publicworks/garbageandrecycling.htm" target="_blank"> Public Work's web page</a>.</p>
